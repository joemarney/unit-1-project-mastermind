# User Stories

## These are declarations that aid the design of the application by clearly stating what is required.

- **As a user,** I want the application to be aesthetically pleasing, clean and clear from an accessibility standpoint.
- **As a user,** I want to see a title screen when I arrive so I know I'm on the right page.
- **As a user,** I want the title screen to have clear and unambiguous buttons that can take me to play the game, show me how to play the game, and some options for the game.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to easily click on the buttons while playing and they should work as intended.
- **As a user,** I want to see a visual change on the page to show me that my selection has been understood.
- **As a user,** I want the feedback from each turn to be clear and concise.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to see when the game is over.
- **As a user,** I want the option to play again.

# Pseudocode

## This is notation resembling a simplified programming language. It helps better understand how the application functions.

1. Define variables to track the state of the game:

   - Randomly generated code.
   - The player's choices.
   - The feedback for player's guesses.
   - The game's result.
   - The result message.

2. Cached elements

   - Home button.
   - Each guess.
   - Colour selector.
   - Check button.
   - Feedback.
   - Reset button.

3. Required constants:

   - Possible colours.
   - Amount of turns.

4. Generate a random colour code.

5. Handle the player clicking buttons.

6. Check if player has guessed correctly.

7. Render a win/loss message to the player.

# Stretch Goals

## If any of the plan is possible. Here are some features I would look at adding in the future.

- I would like to make different difficulties with less turns or more colours in the selection.
- I like to earn achievements in games that I play so I think achievements would be cool to add. Maybe I could make one for guessing the secret code first time and it gives the application a new skin or something.
- I could look at adding a timed mode to up the difficulty too. I played a few of these games and they are a bit easy as you aren't under any pressure to get your guesses out.
- **Ask about the audio required feature!**
